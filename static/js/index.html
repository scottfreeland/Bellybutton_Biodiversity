        <p style="color:whitesmoke; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px">
        The goal of this analysis is to help track the bacterial constitution of various subject participants. Participants agreed to have their belly buttons sampled with a swab in order to identify which bacterial strains are present in one's navel, and the amount of each bacterial strain present. We have partnered with the lab running these tests: Improbable Beef, as they search for bacterial species that can synthesize proteins to produce flavor profiles that mimic the flavors of beef. The makeup of each particpant's belly button fauna will be important to note and follow, as these bacterial species will be tested to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Labs across the US have had success in synthesizing meat flavors from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots - However, Improbable Beef is still searching for the elusive bacteria that will provide the perfect beef taste.<br></br>

        The human body is a source of thousands of types of bacteria. Different parts of the body harbor different species. Furthermore, each human body can produce varied environments, full of a vast array of different bacterial presences. We hypothesize that the ideal bacteria to synthesize proteins to create the best beefy flavor lie in belly buttons - at least someone's belly button, given the diverse spread of bacteria present in any given belly button.<br></br>
          
        So, to test this hypothesis, Improbable Beef labs have gathered samples from individuals all across the country to document various bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons.</p>
